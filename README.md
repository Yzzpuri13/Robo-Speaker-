##Introduction
Robo Speaker is an exciting Python project that utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech. This straightforward yet powerful tool can vocalize any text input it receives, making it an excellent utility for various applications. The current version of the project provides basic text-to-speech functionality, and future updates aim to integrate an NLP API for more intelligent interactions.

##Features
Text to Speech Conversion: Converts any text input into spoken words using the pyttsx3 library.
Interactive Mode: Continuously accepts text input from users and vocalizes it.
Exit Capability: Users can easily exit the program by typing 'exit', upon which the program will say "Bye Bye My Friend" before shutting down.
##Upcoming Enhancements
Integration of NLP API: Plans to enhance the program with natural language processing capabilities, allowing for smarter and more context-aware responses.
##Requirements
Python 3.x
pyttsx3 Library
##Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install pyttsx3 using pip: pip install pyttsx3
##Usage
Run the script in your Python environment. The program will prompt you to input text. After you input the text, the program will vocalize it. To exit, simply type 'exit'.
